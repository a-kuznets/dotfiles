-- Nvim comes bundled with a set of packages that are not enabled by
-- default. You can enable any of them by using the `:packadd` command.

-- For example, to add the "nohlsearch" package to automatically turn off search highlighting after
-- 'updatetime' and when going to insert mode
vim.cmd("packadd! nohlsearch")
